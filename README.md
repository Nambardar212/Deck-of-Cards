# Deck-of-Cards
You display the 52 cards in a standard playing cards deck ‘scattered’ on the screen on the page. 2. At the bottom of the screen, have four ‘cardholders’ - each labeled after a house of cards - spade, diamond, clubs, hearts. 3. The user can ‘clean up’ space by dragging a card and dropping it into the right cardholder. On the second login, the game should start from where they left off. Notes: You can only place a card in the correct cardholder. Spades in spades, hearts in hearts, etc. If all cards are put into the right cardholder, show a “restart” button. If clicked, the cards should be again shuffled in the space above.
